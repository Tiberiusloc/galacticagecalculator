## Description

#### This application was made to show complete understanding of the Red, Green, Refactor workflow by using TDD accompanied with Jest. Tests were written and committed before business logic was written, as well as after receiving a good fail test, business logic was then written and committed after each pass of a test. The user can input their age and the application will return their age and life expectancy on different planets such as, Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. The application will return the life expectancy of the user based off their own input regarding how long they determine they will live(earth years).
